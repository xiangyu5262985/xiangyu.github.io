This repository contains the source code for Dr. Xiangyu Li's personal academic website. The website shows his research interests, publications, and professional activities. It is built using HTML and CSS and is hosted via GitHub Pages.

The academic website serves as an online portfolio that highlights my academic achievements, ongoing research, and areas of expertise. It includes sections on my research, publications, and contact information.

This website was inspired by [Jon Barron's academic website](https://jonbarron.info), and I would like to thank Jon for providing a base template that has been customized for my use.
